# README

This is a calculator app built in React and based on the native iOS calculator.
The main purpose of building this app was to practice React concepts, I didn't
want to spent too long on the calculator logic implementation. I use the `eval`
function a lot to simply things. I know this is frowned upon, but hey I'm
learning React :D

The UI should fit perfectly full screen in most major iOS and Android devices,
anything bigger and the phone UI is centred on the screen.

Feel free to fork the project and play around.

## Potential Improvements
- Text resize as the the number of characters on the screen increases
- Re-writing the calculator logic without `eval`
- Include `C` button implementation
